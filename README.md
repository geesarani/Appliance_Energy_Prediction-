<h2><b>Time Series Forecasting for Appliances Energy Prediction</b></h2>
<h3><b>Overview</b></h3>
This project focuses on predicting appliance energy consumption using a multivariate time-series dataset. The dataset records various environmental and temporal features at 10-minute intervals. The goal is to build a deep learning-based supervised model capable of learning patterns and dependencies from these inputs to forecast future energy usage.

<h3><b>Project Details</b></h3>

<h5><b>Introduction</b></h5>
Energy is a vital element for sustainable development and economic growth. Efficient monitoring and forecasting of energy consumption allows better planning, optimization, and management of resourcesâ€”especially in residential and commercial buildings. This project aims to predict appliance energy consumption using advanced machine learning techniques.

<h5><b>Data Insights</b></h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Hourly Distribution:</strong> Highest electricity consumption occurs between 17:00 and 20:00, while the lowest is observed between 23:00 and 06:00.</li>
    <li><strong>Weekday Distribution:</strong> Electricity consumption on Sundays is significantly higher than on other days.</li>
    <li><strong>General View:</strong> Temperature shows an overall increasing trend, while other features do not show significant patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Appliances Usage:</strong> Electricity usage does not follow a clear pattern over time, indicating the need for deeper analysis to uncover hidden trends.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5><b>Visualization</b></h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Randomly Selected Weekly Data:</strong> Regular ups and downs in energy use suggest hidden habits or routines in appliance usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Histogram for Appliances:</strong> The data is positively skewed with some high energy use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5><b>Correlation Analysis</b></h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Strongest Correlations:</strong> Time of day (0.22) and number of lights on (0.20).</li>
    <li><strong>Weak Correlations:</strong> Air pressure (-0.15) and other environmental factors show weak relationships with appliance usage.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5><b>Clustering Analysis</b></h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Temperature-Related Plots:</strong> Show distinct groupings, indicating reliable classification.</li>
    <li><strong>Humidity-Related Plots:</strong> Show less clear separation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5><b>Preprocessing and Feature Engineering</b></h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No Missing Values:</strong> The dataset is complete.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Time-based features and feature scaling using MinMaxScaler were applied to normalize values.</li>
  </ul>

  <h5><b>Model Design</b></h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>LSTM Model:</strong> An LSTM-based sequential model was used to capture temporal dependencies. The architecture included one LSTM layer with 64 units, a Dropout layer, and a Dense output layer. The model was compiled with Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function.</li>
  </ul>

 <h5><b>Results</b></h5>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>ARIMA and LSTM Models:</strong> Both models showed reasonable performance, with LSTM achieving better accuracy after optimization.</li>
    <li><strong>Optimization Techniques:</strong> Time-based cyclical features and hyperparameter tuning were used to improve model performance.</li>
  </ul>
